# Kid-Friendly Testing Approaches

Age-appropriate testing strategies for family game development with young players.

## Usability Testing for Kids

```python
def test_button_size_accessibility():
    """Test buttons are large enough for small fingers."""
    from src.ui.drawing_helpers import create_button

    # Minimum button size for kids (44x44 pixels recommended)
    button = create_button("Play Game", width=100, height=60)

    assert button.width >= 44
    assert button.height >= 44

    # Test spacing between buttons
    button1 = create_button("Option 1", x=100, y=200)
    button2 = create_button("Option 2", x=100, y=280)

    spacing = button2.y - (button1.y + button1.height)
    assert spacing >= 20  # Minimum 20px spacing

def test_text_readability():
    """Test text is large and clear enough for young readers."""
    import pygame

    # Test font sizes
    small_font = pygame.font.Font(None, 24)
    medium_font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
    large_font = pygame.font.Font(None, 48)

    # Main UI text should be at least medium size
    test_text = "Start Game"
    small_size = small_font.size(test_text)
    medium_size = medium_font.size(test_text)

    # Medium font should produce larger text
    assert medium_size[1] > small_size[1]

    # Test contrast (text should stand out from background)
    screen = pygame.Surface((200, 100))
    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))  # White background

    text_surface = large_font.render(test_text, True, (0, 0, 0))  # Black text
    contrast_ratio = calculate_contrast_ratio((0, 0, 0), (255, 255, 255))
    assert contrast_ratio >= 4.5  # WCAG AA standard

def calculate_contrast_ratio(color1, color2):
    """Calculate contrast ratio between two colors."""
    def luminance(color):
        r, g, b = [c/255.0 for c in color[:3]]
        return 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b

    l1 = luminance(color1)
    l2 = luminance(color2)

    if l1 > l2:
        return (l1 + 0.05) / (l2 + 0.05)
    else:
        return (l2 + 0.05) / (l1 + 0.05)
```

## Error Handling for Young Players

```python
def test_gentle_failure_feedback():
    """Test failures provide encouraging rather than frustrating feedback."""
    from src.scenes.ski import SkiScene

    scene = SkiScene()
    scene.lives = 1

    # Simulate a collision/failure
    scene._handle_obstacle_collision()

    # Should show encouraging message
    assert hasattr(scene, 'encouragement_message')

    # Message should be kid-friendly
    kid_friendly_words = ["try", "again", "good", "job", "almost", "great"]
    message = scene.encouragement_message.lower()

    contains_encouragement = any(word in message for word in kid_friendly_words)
    assert contains_encouragement

def test_no_scary_error_messages():
    """Test error messages avoid technical jargon and scary language."""

    # Simulate various error conditions
    error_messages = [
        "Oops! Let's try that again!",
        "Almost there! Keep going!",
        "That didn't work, but you're doing great!"
    ]

    scary_words = ["error", "failed", "crash", "bug", "exception", "fatal"]

    for message in error_messages:
        message_lower = message.lower()
        contains_scary_words = any(word in message_lower for word in scary_words)
        assert not contains_scary_words
```

## Input Tolerance Testing

```python
def test_forgiving_input_timing():
    """Test input system is forgiving for slower reaction times."""
    from src.entities.player import Player

    player = Player(400, 300, "danger")

    # Test jump buffering - input slightly before landing should still work
    player.is_jumping = True
    player.jump_buffer_time = 0.2  # 200ms buffer

    # Simulate jump input during fall
    player.handle_jump_input()

    # Should queue jump for when landing occurs
    assert hasattr(player, 'queued_jump') or player.jump_buffer_time > 0

def test_movement_input_smoothing():
    """Test movement feels smooth even with imprecise input."""
    from src.entities.player import Player

    player = Player(400, 300, "danger")

    # Test that brief input interruptions don't stop movement
    player.move_right = True
    player.update(dt=0.016, boundaries=[])
    right_pos1 = player.x

    # Brief pause in input (simulating imprecise kid input)
    player.move_right = False
    player.update(dt=0.016, boundaries=[])

    player.move_right = True
    player.update(dt=0.016, boundaries=[])
    right_pos2 = player.x

    # Should continue moving smoothly
    assert right_pos2 > right_pos1
```

## Visual Clarity Testing

```python
def test_important_elements_stand_out():
    """Test important game elements are visually distinct."""
    from src.scenes.hub import HubScene

    scene = HubScene()

    # Test door highlighting
    door = scene.doors[0]
    player = scene.player

    # Move player near door
    player.x = door.rect.centerx
    player.y = door.rect.centery

    door.check_player_proximity(player)

    # Door should be highlighted when player is near
    assert door.is_highlighted

    # Highlighted elements should use high-contrast colors
    highlight_color = door.hover_color
    base_color = door.base_color

    # Colors should be sufficiently different
    color_difference = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(highlight_color, base_color))
    assert color_difference > 100  # Significant visual difference

def test_animation_clarity():
    """Test animations are clear and not too fast for kids to follow."""
    from src.utils.animated_character import AnimatedCharacter

    character = AnimatedCharacter("danger", "assets/images/characters/danger.png")

    # Animation speed should be reasonable for kids to see
    assert character.animation_speed >= 0.1  # At least 100ms per frame

    # Test frame differences are clear
    character.set_animation("walking")
    frame1 = character.get_current_frame()
    character.current_frame = (character.current_frame + 1) % len(character.animations["walking"])
    frame2 = character.get_current_frame()

    # Frames should be visually different (not identical)
    if frame1 and frame2:
        assert frame1 != frame2
```

## Difficulty Progression Testing

```python
def test_gradual_difficulty_increase():
    """Test game difficulty increases gradually and appropriately."""
    from src.scenes.ski import SkiScene

    scene = SkiScene()

    # Test early game is easier
    early_difficulty = scene.get_current_difficulty(game_time=10.0)
    late_difficulty = scene.get_current_difficulty(game_time=50.0)

    assert late_difficulty > early_difficulty

    # But increase shouldn't be too steep
    difficulty_ratio = late_difficulty / early_difficulty
    assert difficulty_ratio <= 2.0  # No more than 2x harder

def test_success_feedback_frequency():
    """Test players get positive feedback frequently enough."""
    from src.scenes.pool import PoolScene

    scene = PoolScene()

    # Simulate gameplay and count positive events
    positive_events = 0
    total_time = 0

    for _ in range(100):  # Simulate 100 game ticks
        scene.update(dt=0.1)
        total_time += 0.1

        # Count collectible spawns, score increases, etc.
        if len(scene.collectibles) > 0:
            positive_events += 1

    # Should have positive events at least every few seconds
    positive_frequency = positive_events / total_time
    assert positive_frequency >= 0.2  # At least one positive event every 5 seconds
```

## Accessibility Testing

```python
def test_colorblind_accessibility():
    """Test game is playable for colorblind players."""

    # Test that important distinctions don't rely only on color
    def test_element_distinction(element1, element2):
        # Elements should differ in more than just color
        shape_different = element1.shape != element2.shape
        size_different = abs(element1.size - element2.size) > 10
        pattern_different = hasattr(element1, 'pattern') and element1.pattern != element2.pattern

        return shape_different or size_different or pattern_different

    # Test collectibles vs obstacles
    from src.entities.snowflake import SnowflakeEffect

    collectible = SnowflakeEffect(100, 100, speed=50)
    obstacle_rect = pygame.Rect(200, 200, 30, 30)

    # Should be distinguishable by more than color
    distinction_exists = (
        collectible.rect.width != obstacle_rect.width or
        hasattr(collectible, 'animation') or
        hasattr(collectible, 'special_shape')
    )
    assert distinction_exists

def test_simple_controls():
    """Test control scheme is simple enough for young players."""

    # Count required keys for basic gameplay
    required_keys = {
        'move_left': ['LEFT', 'a'],
        'move_right': ['RIGHT', 'd'],
        'move_up': ['UP', 'w'],
        'move_down': ['DOWN', 's'],
        'action': ['SPACE'],
        'pause': ['ESCAPE']
    }

    # Should not require more than 6 different key types
    unique_keys = set()
    for key_list in required_keys.values():
        unique_keys.update(key_list)

    assert len(unique_keys) <= 8  # Reasonable number of keys

    # Should have alternative keys for each action
    for action, keys in required_keys.items():
        if action != 'pause':  # Pause can be single key
            assert len(keys) >= 2  # Multiple options for each action
```

## Content Appropriateness Testing

```python
def test_family_friendly_content():
    """Test all content is appropriate for family audiences."""

    # Test sound effects are not jarring or scary
    from src.managers.sound_manager import SoundManager

    sound_manager = SoundManager()

    # Load and check sound files exist (they should be gentle sounds)
    family_safe_sounds = [
        "collect_item.ogg",  # Pleasant collection sound
        "jump.ogg",         # Soft jump sound
        "victory.ogg"       # Celebratory but not overwhelming
    ]

    for sound_file in family_safe_sounds:
        # Should load without error
        loaded = sound_manager.load_sound(f"assets/audio/sfx/{sound_file}")
        assert loaded is not None

def test_positive_messaging():
    """Test game messaging is encouraging and positive."""

    # Test victory messages
    victory_messages = [
        "Great job!",
        "You did it!",
        "Awesome!",
        "Well done!"
    ]

    positive_words = ["great", "awesome", "good", "well", "amazing", "fantastic"]

    for message in victory_messages:
        message_lower = message.lower()
        contains_positive = any(word in message_lower for word in positive_words)
        assert contains_positive

    # Test encouragement after failures
    encouragement_messages = [
        "Try again!",
        "You can do it!",
        "Almost there!"
    ]

    for message in encouragement_messages:
        # Should not contain negative words
        negative_words = ["bad", "wrong", "fail", "lose", "stupid"]
        message_lower = message.lower()
        contains_negative = any(word in message_lower for word in negative_words)
        assert not contains_negative
```
