# CLAUDE.md - Danger Rose Game Development

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for developing the Danger Rose family game project.

## üéÆ Project Overview

**Danger Rose** is a family-friendly Pygame project designed for collaborative development between parents and kids. Players control family members (Danger, Rose, and Dad) through a cozy apartment hub world and three exciting minigames.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Scene Management Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main.py] --> B[SceneManager]
    B --> C[TitleScreen]
    C --> D[CharacterSelect]
    D --> E[HubWorld]
    E --> F[SkiGame]
    E --> G[PoolGame]
    E --> H[VegasGame]
```

### Key Systems
1. **SceneManager** (`src/scene_manager.py`)
   - Manages scene transitions
   - Stores game state
   - Handles scene lifecycle

2. **Base Scene Class**
   ```python
   class Scene(ABC):
       def handle_event(event) -> Optional[str]
       def update(dt: float) -> None
       def draw(screen: Surface) -> None
       def on_enter(previous_scene, data) -> None
       def on_exit() -> Dict[str, Any]
   ```

3. **Animation System** (`src/utils/attack_character.py`)
   - Sprite sheet loading (1024x1024)
   - Frame extraction (256x341 per frame)
   - State-based animations

4. **Asset Management** (`src/utils/sprite_loader.py`)
   - Automatic placeholders for missing assets
   - Centralized path resolution
   - Performance optimization

## üé® Asset Specifications

### Sprite Sheets
```yaml
Format: PNG with transparency
Full Sheet: 1024x1024 pixels
Grid Layout: 3 rows x 4 columns
Frame Size: 256x341 pixels
Display Size: 128x128 (scaled in-game)
```

### Required Animations
- **Idle**: 4 frames
- **Walk**: 8 frames
- **Jump**: 3 frames
- **Attack**: 6 frames
- **Hurt**: 2 frames
- **Victory**: 8 frames

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Core logic, isolated components
2. **Integration Tests**: Scene transitions, save/load
3. **Visual Tests**: Sprite rendering, animations
4. **Performance Tests**: FPS, memory usage

### Writing Game Tests
```python
# Example game test
def test_player_collision():
    """Test that player collides with obstacles correctly"""
    player = Player(x=100, y=100)
    obstacle = Tree(x=100, y=100)

    assert player.check_collision(obstacle) == True
    assert player.lives == 2  # Lost one life
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Simple & Fun Workflow for Game Development

Work however feels natural! No rigid rules here.

#### Easy Three-Step Process:
1. **Choose Work**: `/sv-choose-what-to-work-on` - Pick what sounds fun
2. **Start Coding**: `/sv-start-work` - Begin immediately
3. **Ship It**: `/sv-ship` - Share your progress

#### Flexible Work Options:
- Work on an issue: `/sv-choose-what-to-work-on 24`
- Fix something: `/sv-choose-what-to-work-on fix the jumping bug`
- Add new feature: `/sv-choose-what-to-work-on add particle effects`
- Just explore: `/sv-choose-what-to-work-on experiment with physics`

#### Branch Freedom:
- Work on main? That's fine for quick fixes!
- Want a branch? Create one with any name you like
- No naming conventions required
- Focus on making the game fun!

#### Commit Casually:
Write messages that make sense to you:
- "Add cool explosion effect"
- "Fix that annoying jump bug"
- "Make boss harder"
- "Save progress on new level"

No format requirements - just describe what you did!

### Common Tasks

#### Adding a New Scene
```bash
/create-scene bonus_level minigame
# This creates:
# - src/scenes/bonus_level.py
# - tests/test_bonus_level.py
# - Updates scene registry
```

#### Working with Sprites
```bash
# Validate all sprites
/validate-sprites

# Cut sprite sheet
/sprite-cut path/to/sheet.png 256 341

# Generate placeholder
/generate-placeholder character enemy_boss 128 128
```

#### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Profile current scene
/optimize-fps

# Check memory usage
/profile-memory

# Run performance tests
make profile
```

## üë∂ Kid-Friendly Development

### Explaining Code to Kids
```bash
# Explain a file
/explain-to-kid src/player.py 10

# Create a challenge
/kid-challenge easy loops
```

### Kid-Friendly Features
- **Simple Errors**: Clear, non-technical error messages
- **Visual Feedback**: Animations for all actions
- **Learning Comments**: Explanatory comments in code
- **Fun Commands**: `/celebrate` for achievements!

## üéØ Current Priorities

### High Priority (MVP)
1. **Hub World** (#12-16): Basic navigation and doors
2. **Ski Minigame** (#17-21): Core skiing mechanics
3. **Save System** (#22): Progress persistence
4. **Sound Manager** (#23): Music and SFX

### Medium Priority
1. **Pool Minigame** (#26-29): Target shooting fun
2. **Vegas Minigame** (#30-31): Side-scrolling adventure
3. **Pause Menu** (#24): In-game menu system
4. **High Scores** (#25): Leaderboard tracking

## üìã Working with Issues (Optional!)

### Issues are Just Ideas
- See something cool to work on? Go for it!
- Don't need to follow issues - work on what excites you
- Comment if you want, or just surprise everyone
- No formal process required

### Or Work Without Issues
- Have a cool idea? Just start coding!
- Found a bug while playing? Fix it!
- Want to experiment? Do it!
- Issues are optional, fun is mandatory!

### Creating New Issues
- Use templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Add clear acceptance criteria
- Tag appropriately (enhancement, bug, etc.)
- Set realistic priorities

## üîß Debugging Tips

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Assets**: Check placeholders are generating
2. **Scene Transitions**: Verify scene names in registry
3. **Animation Glitches**: Check frame counts and timing
4. **Performance**: Use debug mode to show FPS

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable all debug output
DEBUG=true make run

# Profile specific system
PROFILE_SYSTEM=animation make run

# Memory debugging
MEMORY_DEBUG=true make run
```

## üöÄ Build & Release

### Building Executables
```bash
# Single platform
make build

# All platforms
make build-all

# Prepare release
make release
```

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Assets validated
- [ ] Version bumped
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Screenshots captured

## üéÆ Game-Specific Patterns

### Movement Code
```python
# Smooth movement with kid-friendly variable names
player_speed = 5.0  # How fast the player moves
player.x += player_speed * direction  # Move in direction
```

### Collision Detection
```python
# Simple rectangle collision
def hits_obstacle(player, obstacle):
    """Check if player bumped into something"""
    return player.rect.colliderect(obstacle.rect)
```

### Score System
```python
# Clear scoring with visual feedback
def collect_item(player, item):
    """Player collected something good!"""
    player.score += item.points
    show_sparkles(item.position)
    play_sound("collect.ogg")
```

**Remember**: This is a family project! Keep code simple, add helpful comments, and make it fun for kids to understand and modify. Every feature should bring joy to players and developers alike! üéÆ‚ú®
