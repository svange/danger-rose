# Game Development Commands - Quick Reference

## Essential Make Commands

```bash
# Core Development
make run                  # Run game normally
make debug               # Run with debug info (FPS, collision boxes)
make test                # Run all tests
make test-fast           # Quick unit tests only
make coverage            # Generate coverage report

# Code Quality
make lint                # Check code style
make format              # Auto-format code
make check               # Run all quality checks
make fix                 # Fix common issues

# Building
make build               # Build executable for current platform
make build-all           # Build for all platforms
make clean               # Clean build artifacts
```

## Scene-Specific Commands

# Kid-friendly mode
make kids                # Simplified errors, bigger text
```

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Standard development cycle
make format              # Format code first
make test-fast           # Quick test cycle
make run                 # Test gameplay
make check               # Full validation before commit

# Performance profiling
make profile             # Run with profiling enabled
make memory-profile      # Check memory usage
```

## Poetry Commands

```bash
poetry install           # Install dependencies
poetry update            # Update dependencies
poetry run python src/main.py  # Run without make
poetry shell             # Enter virtual environment
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Debug options
DEBUG=true make run      # Enable all debug features
FPS_DEBUG=true make run  # Show FPS counter only
COLLISION_DEBUG=true make run  # Show collision boxes

# Scene overrides
