## Co-op Mechanics

### Implementation Strategy
Co-op is designed to be:
- **Drop-in/Drop-out**: Join anytime

- **Non-competitive**: No friendly fire

### Per-Game Co-op

#### Ski Co-op
- Both players on screen
- Shared snowflake collection
- Team combo for synchronized jumps
- Resurrection: Fallen player respawns at partner

#### Pool Co-op
- Split targeting zones
- Combo extends across players
- Special dual-shot power-up
- Cooperative target challenges

#### Vegas Co-op
- Shared health pool
- One sword, one rainbow specialist
- Team attacks do bonus damage
- Boss fight coordination required

### Co-op Exclusive Features
1. **Team Combos**: Synchronized actions = bonus points
2. **Resurrection**: Help fallen teammates
3. **Shared Power-ups**: Benefits both players
4. **Co-op Achievements**: "Perfect Harmony", "Team Carry"
