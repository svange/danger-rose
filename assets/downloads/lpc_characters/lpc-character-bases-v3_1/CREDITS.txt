This is a collection of cleaned up LPC character bases. Many fixes and corrections have been made, and the color counts of each sprite have been reduced to reasonable numbers. Additionally, as of version 3.0, there are headless versions of each body type which can each be mixed and matched with several different heads. Finally, head and hand positions are the same between all body types (except child), meaning that most hats, hair, tools/weapons, etc. can be used with both male and female sprites.


Animations/bases unique to this submission:
- Child slash
- Child hurt
- Child sit
- Child minotaur and boarman heads
- Pregnant cast
- Pregnant thrust
- Pregnant slash
- Pregnant shoot
- Pregnant hurt
- Pregnant sit
- Muscular cast
- Muscular thrust
- Muscular sit
- Male sit (original base)
- Pregnant and muscular orc base
- Re-designed lizardman base



# Changelog
(Frame numbers start at zero)

Version 1 - LPC Contest-era character bases. We are retroactively referring to the bodies developed circa 2012--2013, during and shortly after the original Liberated Pixel Cup contest, e.g. https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-ladies and https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-male-sheets as the "version 1.0" bodies.

Version 2 - Corrections and fixes to original bases:
- Applied Pierre Vigier's corrections to all female and teen bases
- Fixed incorrect thrust and shoot leg positions in all female and teen bases to match male base
- Fixed female and teen bases suddenly crouching in frame 4 of the shoot animation
- Adjusted vertical/horizontal positioning for many frames in female and teen bases to remove sliding and to better match the male base
- Various minor adjustments to shading on female and teen bases
- Fixed many stray pixels on male orc
- Fixed positioning issues on male orc
- Fixed many male orc head connection issues
- Fixed foot position shift in male skeleton thrust animation
- Various minor fixes to male skeleton
- Reduced jittering lines in the muscular base

Version 3 - modular heads version:
- Separated heads from bodies (modular heads)
- tweaks to lizard and wolf heads to accommodate applying heads to different body shapes
- added adult minotaur and boarman heads, child minotaur, boarman, and lizard heads
- added 2-frame idle animation
- added run animation
- added sitting poses
- cast animation, south-facing: made eyes close for lizard head
- shoot animation, south-facing (male, female): re-drew left arm
- slash animation, north-facing (male): slight shading changes to leg in last frame
- slash animation, south-facing (female): shifted head in frame 2 down 1px, frames 3--5 right 1px to match position of male head; re-drew left arm to match hand position of male base
- shoot animation, east/west-facing (male, female): changes to shading of foreground arm
- thrust animation, east/west-facing (female): shifted heads 1px left in frames 4--7 to match male head
- slash animation, east/west-facing (female): shifted heads 1px left in frames 1--3, 2px left in frames 4--5 to match position of male head
- {thrust, shoot} animation, north-facing (female): frame 1 redrawn to match male base
- shoot animation, south-facing (female): added breasts, which added 1px to the silhouette under the character's right arm
- all changes to female sprites also applied to teen and pregnant sprites
- numerous additional shading fixes


# Usage

Heads and bodies are separated so that you can mix-and-match. This has a few benefits:

- It is easier to create humanoid creatures (orc, lizard, minotaur, etc.) by swapping different heads to recolored bodies; if you create a new head, you can apply it to all of the (adult) body shapes easily.
- You can animate the heads separately from the body if you wish, for example to add facial expressions
- The head is on a separate layer, so you can draw clothing that appears over the body but under the head; this is useful for creatures like the wolfman, where the snout extends below jaw of the human head.

To assemble a spritesheet, simply layer the head animations over the body animations. Some clothing items (e.g. shirts) should go underneath the head, while others (e.g. hats) should go over top.

To create a new head, use the template in `_build/heads/human_male.png`, then run `build.sh` to generate a full set of spritesheets.
