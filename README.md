## 🏠 About

**Danger Rose** is a cozy family game built with Python and Pygame. Players control Danger, Rose, or Dad as they explore an apartment hub world and play various minigames.

Each minigame offers a different adventure - from skiing down mountains to water balloon battles at the pool to side-scrolling action in Vegas. The game continues to grow with new minigames being added regularly.
