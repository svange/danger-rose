## üéÆ Security Considerations for a Game Project

While Danger Rose is a family-friendly game, we still maintain security best practices:

### Data Storage
- Game saves are stored locally only
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- High scores are stored locally

### Dependencies
- We regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Run `poetry update` to get the latest secure versions

### Code Security
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- All user input is validated
- File paths are sanitized

## üìã Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.10.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.10  | :x:                |

## üîí Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to Danger Rose, please:

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - API keys, tokens, passwords must use environment variables
   - Check your commits before pushing

2. **Validate input**
   - Always validate user input in minigames
   - Sanitize file paths

3. **Update dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Check for security advisories

4. **Safe file operations**
   - Use pathlib for file operations
   - Validate file paths are within expected directories

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Local File Access
The game reads and writes save files locally. These operations are restricted to the game's data directory.

### Asset Loading
The game loads images and sounds from the assets directory. All paths are validated before loading.

### Network
Currently, Danger Rose does not make any network requests. If this changes in the future, we will update our security policy accordingly.

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ For Parents

Danger Rose is designed with child safety in mind:
- No online features or chat
- No data collection
- No in-app purchases
- No external links

Your children can safely play and even modify the game code without security concerns.

## üìù Security Checklist for Releases

Before each release, we ensure:
- [ ] No secrets in code or commit history
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security scanning passes
- [ ] No vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] File operations are properly bounded

Thank you for helping keep Danger Rose secure for all our players!
