## Request: Patch Release for Dependabot Auto-Merge Testing

We need a **patch version bump** to test the Dependabot auto-merge workflow we just implemented in the `augint-api` serverless template.

### What to do:
1. **Create a trivial patch change** in `augint-library` (e.g., update a comment, fix typo, add docstring)
2. **Release as patch version** (current: v1.23.1 → target: v1.23.2)
3. **Ensure it publishes to PyPI** so Dependabot can detect it

### Expected behavior in augint-api:
- Dependabot detects new version within 1-6 hours
- Creates PR: "build(deps): bump augint-library from 1.23.1 to 1.23.2"
- Auto-merge workflow activates
- Full CI/CD pipeline runs (6 stages)
- PR auto-approves and merges after all checks pass ✅

### Why this tests our automation:
- **End-to-end validation** of enterprise DevOps pipeline
- **Proof of concept** for self-healing security updates
- **Real-world simulation** of dependency management workflow

### Context:
We've built a complete serverless API template with:
- ✅ Enterprise CI/CD pipeline (10 parallel stages)
- ✅ Dependabot auto-merge for security patches
- ✅ Two-account AWS architecture
- ✅ Full test coverage and automation

**This patch release will validate that our "infrastructure as cattle" vision works in practice.**

**Priority**: High (testing critical automation)  
**Type**: Patch release (safe, no breaking changes)  
**Timeline**: When convenient for you

Thank you for helping test our enterprise DevOps automation! 🚀
